# To Be Done List

- BufferView has alignment restrictions that are overkill (eg, can't create a 28-byte vertex format if there's a vec2 in there)

- a build/minify system that uses jslint and minification
   - 2 space indention
   - ' over "
   - function expressions over declarations
    
 - write some rst docs like [this](http://vimalkumar.in/sphinx-themes/solar/html/index.html)
    
- PolygonTess
  - degenerate triangle
  - Move eval into a worker?
- Rewrite a portion (or all) of my Knot Browser with giza.
- Turntable: Spin inertia with physical mouse doesn't work.
  I think we can implement something robust by computing an average velocity:
  Keep around a small history of (time,spin,tilt) samples, taken during the drawHook.
- Combine Turtle and Path; use SVG [Path.getPointAtLength](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12253855/svg-path-getpointatlength-returning-wrong-values)
- Turntable
  - HomePosition
  - Pan / Zoom (similar to tdsview controls)
- manipulators, BEAUTIFUL [docs](http://folyo.me/), fresnel/marble spiral horn
- test & impl rotateAxis and scale in Matrix4
    
- consider purchase of [this image](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-89787958/stock-vector-egyptian-pyramids-with-camels-at-sunrise.html
)

- "strict" mode?
